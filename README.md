Trader is an algorithmic trading framework and execution host built on Microsoft Orleans.

Trader aims to help you write trading algorithms while letting the host handle the real-time workings of the underlying exchange during execution.

Trader only works with Binance at the moment. Support for more exchanges is in the road map.

As a Microsoft Orleans application, Trader will integrate and scale with your own Orleans cluster or run on its own.

Warning: This is a work-in-progress. If trading comes with risk, algorithmic trading even more so. Use at your own risk.
