-- The design criteria for this table are:
--
-- 1. It can contain arbitrary content serialized as binary, XML or JSON. These formats
-- are supported to allow one to take advantage of in-storage processing capabilities for
-- these types if required. This should not incur extra cost on storage.
--
-- 2. The table design should scale with the idea of tens or hundreds (or even more) types
-- of grains that may operate with even hundreds of thousands of grain IDs within each
-- type of a grain.
--
-- 3. The table and its associated operations should remain stable. There should not be
-- structural reason for unexpected delays in operations. It should be possible to also
-- insert data reasonably fast without resource contention.
--
-- 4. For reasons in 2. and 3., the index should be as narrow as possible so it fits well in
-- memory and should it require maintenance, isn't resource intensive. For this
-- reason the index is narrow by design (ideally non-clustered). Currently the entity
-- is recognized in the storage by the grain type and its ID, which are unique in Orleans silo.
-- The ID is the grain ID bytes (if string type UTF-8 bytes) and possible extension key as UTF-8
-- bytes concatenated with the ID and then hashed.
--
-- Reason for hashing: Database engines usually limit the length of the column sizes, which
-- would artificially limit the length of IDs or types. Even when within limitations, the
-- index would be thick and consume more memory.
--
-- In the current setup the ID and the type are hashed into two INT type instances, which
-- are made a compound index. When there are no collisions, the index can quickly locate
-- the unique row. Along with the hashed index values, the NVARCHAR(nnn) values are also
-- stored and they are used to prune hash collisions down to only one result row.
--
-- 5. The design leads to duplication in the storage. It is reasonable to assume there will
-- a low number of services with a given service ID operational at any given time. Or that
-- compared to the number of grain IDs, there are a fairly low number of different types of
-- grain. The catch is that were these data separated to another table, it would make INSERT
-- and UPDATE operations complicated and would require joins, temporary variables and additional
-- indexes or some combinations of them to make it work. It looks like fitting strategy
-- could be to use table compression.
--
-- 6. For the aforementioned reasons, grain state DELETE will set NULL to the data fields
-- and updates the Version number normally. This should alleviate the need for index or
-- statistics maintenance with the loss of some bytes of storage space. The table can be scrubbed
-- in a separate maintenance operation.
--
-- 7. In the storage operations queries the columns need to be in the exact same order
-- since the storage table operations support optionally streaming.
